Budget App 
This app starts off at a home screen welcoming user to Budget App then asks to "start budgeting". When user clicks "start budgeting" button, a calculator appears for user to input current money they have in their bank account into text fields (checkings and savings), then asks user to input all monthly bills into text fields (rent, utilities, insurance, memeberships, food, entertainment, etc.) Then when user clicks submit, a calculation of their total money spent over the month appears as well as a calculation of how much money they have left over. A meme will also appear when user hits submit based off how much money is left in their account. If user fails to input a number into any of the text fields an error message will appear to tell them to enter an integer value or 0 for nothing.
